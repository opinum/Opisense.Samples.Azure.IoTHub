# Opisense.Samples.Azure.IoTHub.DevicesCreatedFromOpisense

In this sample, you'll learn how to integrate Opisense and Azure IoT Hub in the case where Opisense is the master of the Source creation.

This means that when a source is created Opisense will trigger a webhook and the Azure IoT Device will be created with an Azure Function.
